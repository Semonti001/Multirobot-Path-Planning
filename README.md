# Multirobot-Path-Planning
A* algorithm has been updated using Conflict-based Search and Prioritized planning strategies to make a further comparison with Q-learning, one of the effective Reinforcement Learning AI-based techniques in OpenAI Gym environment. The study investigates the implementation of these algorithms within a custom grid environment, focusing on their effectiveness in navigating static and dynamic obstacles and achieving goals while minimizing collisions.
